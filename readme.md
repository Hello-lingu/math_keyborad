# math keyborad
This is a vitrual keyborad to input math symbols

# hint
You need to set this program's window to be unfocused. 
There is no API to do this in Fyne, so you shound accord use your system setting to achieve it

## My environment
I have only made sure it runs on my computer:
'Debian 12', 'kde 5', 'go 1.24.3', 'Fyne lastest'
